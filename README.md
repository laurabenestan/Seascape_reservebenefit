# seascape_reservebenefit

The objective of this project is to dissect the link between genomics and environmental gradients of differentiation in a context of conservation of marine reserves.
Using a state-of-the-art approach based on seascape genomics, we aim to:

01. Estimating genetic diversity within and outside a network of marine reserve, delineating the influence of spatial and environmental gradient on the genetic diversity observed
02. Comparing historical and contemporary population structure across species occupying a similar seascape
03. Characterising the seascape differentiation experienced by the species
04. Determining the influence of the marine reserve position, seascape features and spatial distribution on the population structure 
05. Bringing useful recommendations for marine reserve design
