# seascape_reservebenefit

The goal of this project is to dissect the link genomics and environmental gradients of differentiation in a context of marine reserve conservation.
Using a state of art population genomics approach, we aim to:

1- Estimating genetic diversity within and outside a network of marine reserve, delineating the influence of spatial and environmental gradient on the genetic diversity observed
2- Comparing historical and contemporary population structure across species occupying a similar seascape
3- Characterising the seascape differentiation experienced by the species
4- Determining the influence of the marine reserve position, seascape features and spatial distribution on the population structure 
5- Bringing useful recommendations for marine reserve design
